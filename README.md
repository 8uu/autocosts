## Automobile costs calculator<br>
https://autocosts.info<br>

This calculator allows users to find the true cost of owning a car. It will normally give them a good estimate of what they really need to spend on car ownership. As car payments and expenses come due throughout the year, it's often difficult to really get a good understanding of total spending on a car. By default, these values are calculated on a monthly basis. 

This calculator is completely anonymous, as it doesn't request nor permanently store, any name, email, cookies, IP address nor any other personal information.
