color:#333333'>The Austrian philosopher Ivan Illich, a critic of the modern
society habits, was one of the first thinkers to establish the so-called&nbsp;<b>consumer
speed</b>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<b>virtual speed</b>&nbsp;concept. He wrote in his book&nbsp;<i>Energy
and Habits</i>&nbsp;published in 1974:</span></p>

color:#333333'>The model American male devotes more than 1600 hours a year to
his car. He sits in it while it goes and while it stands idling. He parks it
and searches for it. He earns the money to put down on it and to meet the
monthly installments. He works to pay for gasoline, tolls, insurance, taxes,
and tickets. He spends four of his sixteen waking hours on the road or
gathering his resources for it. And this figure does not take into account the
time consumed by other activities dictated by transport: time spent in hospitals,
traffic courts, and garages; time spent watching automobile commercials or
attending consumer education meetings to improve the quality of the next buy.
The model American puts in 1600 hours to get 7500 miles: less than five miles
per hour [the consumer speed]. In countries deprived of a transportation
industry, people manage to do the same, walking wherever they want to go, and
they allocate only 3 to 8 percent of their society's time budget to traffic
instead of 28 percent. What distinguishes the traffic in rich countries from
the traffic in poor countries is not more mileage per hour of lifetime for the
majority, but more hours of compulsory consumption of high doses of energy,
packaged and unequally distributed by the transportation industry.</span></i></p>
