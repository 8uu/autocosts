Automobile costs calculator
=========

This calculator allows users to find the true cost of owning a car. It will normally give them a good estimate of what they really need to spend on car ownership. As car payments and expenses come due throughout the year, it's often difficult to really get a good understanding of total spending on a car. By default, these values are calculated on a monthly basis. 

This calculator is and shall be completely anonymous, as it doesn't request nor permanently store, any name, email, cookies, IP address nor any other personal information.

### The list of available countries
https://autocustos.info/list

The translations are in corresponding `json` files, namely in the folder `src/countries/`.<br>
The list of available countries is from the file `src/countries/list.json`

## How to install

Clone it, install it, build it and run it<br>
`git clone https://github.com/jfoclpf/autocosts.git`<br>
`cd autocosts/ && npm install`<br>
`node bin/index.js`

This will run a `node` server application with the calculator. For more information on builidng run `./build.sh -h`. For more information on the application run `node bin/index.js -h`.

## How does it work?

Autocosts uses `nodejs`, `expressjs` and `handlebars` to supply a server application that renders a car costs calculator as a webpage loaded by any common browser. 

The project is optimized for a web-based version, and for an APP developped in Apache Cordova. The `XX` stands for the 2-letter ISO country code, and not for the language, since for example United Kingdom and Australia have the same language but different realities concerning the taxes, the terms applied to automobile costs and the units for fuel efficiency. The translations/language files apply therefore only to the selected country. Additional countries are very welcomed.

The project already considers all the units and fuel efficiency cases, different in many countries. The variations for fuel efficiency are `l/100km`, `km/l`, `mpg(US)`, `mpg(imp)` and for distance are `km`, `miles` and `mil` (Nordic mile=10km). More information can be found in the directory `src/countries/`.

For more information regarding how the costs are calculated, you can check the `src/client/core/coreFunctions.js` which is based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_costs">12 items that form the car costs</a> for any given country. Namely they are:

* Standing costs
  * Depreciation
  *	Car taxes
  *	Insurance
  *	Inspection
  *	Car finance
* Running costs
  *	Fuel
  *	Maintenance
  *	Repairs and Improvements
  *	Parking
  *	Tolls
  *	Fines
  * Car washes

### Aditional services
Autocosts supports the following additional services, which can be enabled or disabled, 
using the `node bin/index.js` command line options:

```
Usage: node index.js [options]
Ex:    node index.js -r prod --uber --dataBase

Options: 
-r, --release              'work' for tests or 'prod' for production
-p, --port                 HTTP port on which the application is listening (default:3000)

    External API services, disabled by default
    API credentials must be in either credentials/work/ or credentials/prod/ according to release
    --https                Enables protocol https when available
    --cdn                  Enables Content Delivery Network
    --uber                 Enables UBER API
    --social               Enables social media plugin
    --googleCharts         Enables Google Charts for report
    --googleCaptcha        Enables Google Captcha V2 anti-bot for calculation button
    --googleAnalytics      Enables Google Analytics
    --dataBase             Enables a mysql Database
    --print                Enables option to print, on the final report
    --pdf                  Enables option to download pdf repor on final report

-A  --all                  Enables all the previous services
```

### Database

Autocosts also supports code such that the user inputs might be stored into a `mysql` database. 
The credentials file for said databse should be stored in directory `credentials/prod/` or `credentials/work/`, 
the latter being the test version.

This file `dataBase.json` should look like:

```
{
    "host"      : "*****",
    "user"      : "*****",
    "password"  : "*****",
    "database"  : "*****",
    "db_tables" : {
        "country_specs"    : "country_specs" ,
        "users_insertions" : "users_insertions",
        "monthly_costs_statistics" : "monthly_costs_statistics"
  }
}
```

With the data from said database, it is also possible to make several statisitcal analysis, 
namely the average costs for each country, said statistical analysis having outlier removal techniques, 
such that such outliers do not distort the average.

### Uber

Autocosts uses the UBER API, such that at the final repport, 
the user calculations can be compared with the equivalents costs if the user would use just UBER.

The uber secret token file `uber.json` should be stored in `credentials/prods/` or `credentials/work/`, 
the latter being the test version. This file `uber.json` should be like:

```
{
    "token": "********************************************"
}
```

### Google Charts

Autocosts uses Google Charts to render the final charts, with several analysys. 
We plan to move to <a href=http://www.chartjs.org/>chartjs.org</a> as it is free, open source and can be used offline.

### Google Analytics

You can add your Google Analytics credentials. 
The file `googleAnalytics.json` should be stored in `credentials/prods/` or `credentials/work/`, 
the latter being the test version. This file `googleAnalytics.json` should be like:

```
{
    "trackingId": "UA-*******-*"
}
```

### Google Captcha v2

Autocosts support the Google Captcha v2 API to avoid spam bots from poluting the database. 
The captcha secret key file `googleCaptcha.json` should be stored in `credentials/prods/` or `credentials/work/`, 
the latter being the test version. 
This file `googleCaptcha.json` should be like:

```
{ Â 
    "secretKey" : "*************************************"
}
```

### PDF

Autocosts also allow the final report to be printed into a PDF report. It makes use of `pdfmake` npm package.

## Android APP<br>

The <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.autocosts">Android APP can be found in Play Store</a>. It uses <a href="https://cordova.apache.org/">Apache Cordova</a> to convert JavaScript built code into APP built files (for example APK files in Android)
